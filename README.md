**Project Description**:This Selenium automation project performs an end-to-end flow on Flipkart by searching for “Bluetooth Speakers,” applying filters, sorting results, and opening the first product.
It checks whether the Available Offers section exists and prints the number of offers.
If the product is available, it adds it to the cart and captures cart_result.png; otherwise, it captures result.png.
The script handles popups, multiple tabs, product availability validation, and screenshot capture using Selenium WebDriver in Chrome.

**Steps for script:**
source path-src/test/java
package-assessment
class file-Scenario1
Screenshot folder-Screenshots
project files-pom.xml and README.md

The script according to the scenario is written inside "Scenario1" in "assessment" package inside "src/test/java".
The "Screenshots" folder contains the screenshots for the same and it contains one more screenshot for a test check with other available product when "Add To Cart" button is enabled.
